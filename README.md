# Machine Learning Forecasting: Predicting Social Media Followers for Spane 4 All

For Spane 4 All, a firm in South Africa, this work looks at how follower counts on social media might change going forward. It employs both Facebook Prophet techniques alongside standard linear regression - examining past activity to spot repeating cycles, overall shifts, also how quickly things expand.

üîç Key Features:

Predicting how many followers you‚Äôll have later, employing a method called Prophet that builds on simple addition
We gauged how well it did by comparing its results to those from simple linear regression
Showing forecasts alongside errors helps people understand what‚Äôs happening
Code that anyone can follow, check, rework - all thanks to clear notes alongside each step

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Prophet, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

I‚Äôm building this because I want to use tech to help businesses across Africa. Feel free to pitch in ‚Äì your thoughts matter!
